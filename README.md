# MultiCropDiseaseClassification
This project implements a deep learning-based solution for the classification of diseases in multiple crops, such as potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and capsicum. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system analyzes images of plant leaves and identifies various diseases, enabling timely intervention and better crop management.
